ALTERNATIVE, BASED ON THE CURRENT FLOW

clients schedule their appointments. however, depending on trainer availability,
 they possibly have to wait for confirmation.

the machine notifies the next trainer on the list to be offered the session. 
trainer confirms or turns down the appointment.

there must be a time limit on confirming the appointment. this rule, plus the fixed number of trainers, should guarantee the client's appointment is confirmed within a reasonable amount of time.
